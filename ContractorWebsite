		<p>I cannot say enought about the work Jenkins did for me. Recently I needed some work corrected on a room addition done poorly by another contractor, and i was on a short timeframe. I simply called Mr. Jenkins and he prompltry, made an estimate, and got to the work immediately. The end result was better than i expected. I will use their company again without hesitation. I highly recommend this company to anyone for quality work and courteous service. It is wihout a doubt absolutely 5 star service
